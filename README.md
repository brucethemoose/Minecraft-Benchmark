# Minecraft-Benchmark

Simple, objective Minecraft benchmarking script.

All configuration is done at the top of the Python file. Run the file, and launch/chunkgen times will be printed for each of your tested instances. 

Make sure your commands work, as the script will simply hang if Minecraft errors out.
