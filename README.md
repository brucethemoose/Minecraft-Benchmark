# Minecraft-Benchmark

Simple, objective Minecraft benchmarking script.

It measures how long a Minecraft server takes to start up, and how long it takes to run a command (like chunk pregeneration).

All configuration is done at the top of the Python file. Run the file, and launch/chunkgen times will be printed for each of your tested instances.
